# AM_ESP8266WiFi

This is an Arduino library to work with Arduino Manager app available for iOS and macOS.

 * Supported Boards: Any ES8622 board
 * Protocol: WiFi

 **Please Note:** This library is for using the ESP8266 board as microcontroller. If you need to use the ESP8622 just as WiFi communication device (connecting it to your microcontroller via UART), you need a this library instead:

## Arduino Manager

Arduino Manager allows you to control and receive data from any Arduino or Arduino compatible microcontroller. It provides:

* More than 30 widgets (switch, knob, slider, display, gauge, bar, etc.) you can choose from
* A Code Generator to generate Arduino code quickly and easily
